# LASSIE: Legged Autonomous Surface Science In Analogue Environments

Welcome to LASSIE! The overall study objective is to enhance scientific outcomes of robot-aided planetary explorations, by integrating high mobility legged robots with embedded
terrain-sensing technologies and cognitive human decision models. State-of-the-art rovers
and robots typically operate based on pre-programmed agenda, and have limited capabilities to: 

i) effectively detect unexpected changes in terrain properties and responses and adjust
locomotion or sampling strategies; 

ii) autonomously identify scientifically-valuable observations and adjust exploration strategies. 

Such inefficiency can lead to critical mobility
or sampling failures, and missed scientific discoveries. To bridge this gap, we propose to
integrate legged mobility, direct-drive embedded terrain-sensing, and human-robot collab-
orative decision-making workflow, to enable terrain-sensible, discovery-driven legged
robots that can effectively move, adaptively situate, and scientifically examine a wide range
of planetary environments.
